Famous People App

Let's create a new React application for our favorite famous people! To get started with the assignment:

Don't fork this repo. Use these instructions, however!

Make a new app called react-famous-people with create-react-app.

You'll have to make a repo on your own github account. Don't initialize with a README.

Once you've made the repo on github, you need the URL for it. Use it in the command below.

cd react-famous-people
git remote add origin <URL>
git push origin master

Required Features

    Create a Header Component to show the app name in a colored banner across the top of the page
    Create a FamousPerson Component with properties in the Component state for a name and role
    Add input fields to allow the entry of a name and role, and save these in the component's state as they are entered
    Display the famous person's information on the the DOM in a format like 'Felicia Day is famous for "The Guild"'.

    Remember Start with everything in your App component to get things working, then split out your 2 components (Header & FamousPerson).

Stretch Goals

    Create a Submit button that logs the famous person's name and role to the console when the button is clicked.
    Store all of the properties in a single person object in the component state.
